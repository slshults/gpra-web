                Welcome to the boring details about the terms of service for using GPRA (Guitar Practice Routine App.) I'm pleasantly surprised you're reading this... <br><br>
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300">
                (Caution: Below you will encounter snarkiness with humorous intent. Don't take it personally. Well, unless you're one of those Karenesque asshats who thinks it's fun to roam the internet looking for people to hassle, in which case: Do take it personally 😆 and seek therapy too.)
                </p>       
                 <br>
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                These terms outline how you can use this site/app, what you can and can't expect from this app, and what I expect for your use of the app. I've tried to keep this straightforward and basic, but just <a href="#" onclick="triggerFeedbackSurvey(event)" class="text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400 hover:underline">reach out</a> if you have any questions or concerns.<br><br>
            </p>

                Know that I am not a corporation, nor a 'tech bro', nor am I hoping to sell this app for a big payday. I'm just some guy who built his own guitar practice routine app (after not being able to find one I liked) then turned it into a webapp for others to use. I'm mostly just hoping I'll make enough money to pay for the hosting fees. (If I make a little extra money to help pay down credit card debt, that'll be a nice surprise.)
            </p>

                <p>
                    By creating an account and using GPRA, you agree to these Terms of Service and the
                    <a href="/privacy" class="text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400 hover:underline">Privacy Policy</a>.
                    If you don't agree with these terms, please don't use this app.
                </p>
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
                    (Seriously though. Just don't. There's nothing sketchy going on here, so if you're the paranoid sort, go elsewhere. I just want to help people with their guitar practice routines, I'm not looking to rip anyone off. I'm even less interested in dealing with weird false accusations based on imaginary issues from people with unaddressed mental health issues.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    I may update these terms from time to time. I'll notify you of any significant changes with an in-app notification at your next login. Your continued use of GPRA after changes means you accept the new terms. (To cancel or pause your subscription and/or delete your account, go to the <a href="/#Account" class="text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400 hover:underline">account/settings page</a>, then scroll down to the "<em>Danger zone</em>".)

            <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                <p>
                    <strong>Your account is <em>your</em> responsibility</strong>: Keep your password secure. Don't share your account with anyone else. You're responsible for all activity on your account. If you let someone use your account and they screw up your data, that's on you. Likewise, if you let someone use your account and they abuse it, you'll be responsible for any damages they cause. The fees are low. If you're sharing it with a friend because they can't afford an account of their own, <a href="#" onclick="triggerFeedbackSurvey(event)" class="text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400 hover:underline">reach out</a>. I am willing to give discount codes to your broke bandmates, people between day jobs, students, etc. (Note: I do not give discounts for people claiming their account is related to playing for worship services. Your church doesn't pay taxes, so ask them to reimburse you for your account.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Eligibility:</strong> You must be at least 13 years old to use GPRA. If you're under 18, you should have parental permission to use the service. (There's nothing inappropriate for kids here, I just don't want to deal with your angry parents if you spend money on an account without their permission.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Account accuracy:</strong> Provide accurate information when signing up. (I don't spam, or sell email addresses. You need to use a real email address so you can reset your password if you forget it. Also, if you need help accessing your data, I will protect your data by making sure you can access the email account you signed up with before I give you any data.)  You can change your info on the <a href="/#Account" class="text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400 hover:underline">account/settings page</a>. (Btw, if you signed up with your Tidal account, I didn't ask Tidal for your email address, so your account will show a fake email address. You can add a real address if you like.)

            <div class="space-y-4 text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
                <p>
                    <strong>Subscription tiers:</strong> GPRA offers 5 subscription tiers:
                </p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
                    <li><strong>Free:</strong> 15 practice items, 1 routine, BYOClaude for autocreated chord charts<br>(no credit card required, ad supported)</li>
                    <li><strong>Basic:</strong> 80 practice items, 5 routines, BYOClaude for autocreated chord charts (no ads)</li>
                    <li><strong>The Goods:</strong> 200 practice items, 10 routines, autocreated chord charts included (no ads)</li>
                    <li><strong>More Goods:</strong> 600 practice items, 25 routines, autocreated chord charts included (no ads)</li>
                    <li><strong>The Most:</strong> 1500 practice items, 50 routines, autocreated chord charts included (no ads)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <strong>Billing periods:</strong> Subscriptions are monthly. The billing period begins the same day of month/year on which you first subscribe. (No refunds, prorated or otherwise if you cancel mid-month, but you can keep using it until the end of the period you've already paid for.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Payment processing:</strong> All payments are processed securely via <a href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400 hover:underline">Stripe</a>. (I never see your credit card number, nor can I store it (even encrypted), because Stripe protects your card info. You're interacting with Stripe's system when you enter your card info, and if you have any issues with your payment or card, you'll be interacting with <a href="https://support.stripe.com/contact/login" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400 hover:underline">Stripe support</a>, not me.) Charges will appear as "GPRA" or "Guitar Practice Routine App" on your statement.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Automatic renewal:</strong> Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period, unless you cancel beforehand. You can cancel anytime from <a href="/#Account" class="text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400 hover:underline">Account Settings</a> or the Stripe Customer Portal.<br><br> 
                    
                    <strong>NOTE:</strong> You cannot cancel via the feedback form or by sending email. I'm one guy, I don't have a billing team, so you'll need to be a grown up and cancel it yourself. Go to the <a href="/#Account" class="text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400 hover:underline">Account / Settings page</a> via the gear icon in the upper-right of any page, then scroll down to the "<em>Danger zone</em>" in order to cancel.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Cancellation policy:</strong> When you cancel, you keep access until the end of your current billing period, which you've already paid for. After that, your account enters "unplugged mode" which allows you to use the free tier. I'll keep your data for 90-days, and you'll get it back if you renew within 90 days.<br><br> 
                    
                    There are no refunds, prorated or otherwise. I provide a free tier to allow you to try the app before subscribing. Do not buy before you try, that's just... not smart. I won't give you a refund just because you failed to try it for free before you subscribed and then decided it wasn't what you thought it was.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Prorating:</strong> If you downgrade mid-month, you'll receive a prorated credit for the unused portion of your current plan. If you upgrade, the prorated additional amount for the rest of the month will be charged at that time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>No Refunds:</strong> I generally don't offer refunds except in extenuating circumstances. Don't buy before you try, that's just not smart. I won't give you a refund just because you subscribed before trying it for free. Free mode does not require a credit card, so you can't be 'tricked' into accidentally subscribing. (I'm just one guy, and this is a hobby app. I don't have a corporation or investors to cover refunds. So don't subscribe until you've tried the free mode.)
                    <br><br> 
                    If you don't have the patience to create your own Anthropic API key to try autocreate in free mode, you still won't get a refund if you don't like the results of the autocreate feature. (You're learning to play guitar, which means you have the intelligence required for following simple instructions, so you are capable of creating an Anthropic account and API key to try autocreate with. It doesn't take any special knowledge or skill to try autocreate for free.)

                    <strong>Chord chart autocreate:</strong> When you use the AI-powered chord chart autocreate feature, your uploaded images are sent to Anthropic's Claude API for analysis (See the <a href="/privacy" class="text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-400 hover:underline">Privacy Policy</a> for details.) <strong>Note:</strong> Autocreated chord charts <em>will contain errors</em> because they're created by an AI. You will need to correct the errors yourself. I will not give refunds or discounts for incorrect chord charts, nor will I respond to any requests to correct your chord charts for you. (I am providing you with access to the tools for less than the cost of a set of guitar strings. I am not your teacher, your assistant, your roadie, or your mom, so don't ask me to do work for you.)

                    If I find you're violating these terms or abusing the app or service, I will probably give you a warning first, but I may also just suspend or terminate your account, and delete your data, without warning. You will not get any refunds if I terminate your account for abuse. (None of this should worry you unless you're planning on abusing the app and/or service. If you're worried about it that means you're thinking about violating these terms, so don't create an account. Go away.)

                    GPRA is provided <strong>"as is" without warranties of any kind</strong>.

                    <li>Uninterrupted or error-free service (there are multiple companies involved in the services used in the hosting and functionality of this app.)</li>
                    <li>Specific results from using the app (All software has bugs. You may be using browser addons which break parts of the app. Services the app relies on may have problems or outages. Reality is a thing.)</li>
                    <li>Accuracy of AI-generated chord charts (It's AI. It saves us a lot of time, but it's fallible. Expect to have to correct some of the autocreated chord charts yourself.)</li>
                    <li>That the service will meet all your needs or expectations (e.g. if you signed up expecting tabs, or sheet music, instead of chord charts, that's on you. I've published nothing implying the site can handle tabs or sheet music. If you don't know the difference, that's on you too. Also, there's no autoscroll, there's no midi player, no hand-holding, etc. But it is open source, so feel free to submit pull requests for consideration.)</li>

Practice will make you a better player, whether you use this app or not. Practice safely: Always stretch, warm up, take breaks, etc, don't hurt yourself. ("I've got blisters on my fingers!"
